# Insurance Policy Tracker UI Design Inspiration

## Pizza Tracker UI Examples

### Domino's Pizza Tracker
The Domino's Pizza Tracker is a classic example of a progress tracking interface that shows users where their order is in the process. Key elements include:

1. **Linear Progress Bar**: Shows clear progression through stages
2. **Distinct Stages**: Order Placed → Prep → Bake → Quality Check → Ready for Pickup
3. **Current Stage Highlight**: Visual indication of the current stage
4. **Completed Stages**: Visual differentiation for completed stages
5. **Status Text**: Additional context about what's happening at the current stage
6. **Estimated Time**: Shows when the process started and expected completion

### Design Principles to Apply
From the pizza tracker research, these principles should be applied to our insurance policy tracker:

1. **Clarity**: Clear, simple stages that are easy to understand
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Highlight the current stage prominently
3. **Progress Indication**: Show how far along the policy is in the process
4. **Status Context**: Provide additional information about what's happening at each stage
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure text contrast and readability
6. **Consistency**: Use consistent colors and icons throughout the interface
7. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Design should work well on both desktop and mobile
