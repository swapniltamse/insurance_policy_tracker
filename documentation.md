# Insurance Policy Tracker Documentation

## Overview

The Insurance Policy Tracker is a web-based application designed to provide insurance advisors with a clear visualization of policy status throughout the underwriting process. Inspired by the popular "pizza tracker" concept, this application breaks down the complex insurance policy lifecycle into distinct, easy-to-understand stages.

## Purpose

This application addresses several key challenges faced by insurance advisors:

1. Limited visibility into policy processing status
2. Difficulty communicating progress to clients
3. No standardized way to track policies through underwriting
4. Time wasted on status inquiries
5. Client anxiety during the waiting period

By providing a visual tracker, the application improves advisor efficiency, enhances client communication, and modernizes the insurance process.

## Features

### 1. Visual Policy Progression

The core feature is a visual tracker that shows the policy's progress through seven key stages:

- **Application Submitted**: Initial application has been received
- **Underwriting in Progress**: Risk assessment has begun
- **Medical Review**: Medical information is being evaluated
- **Final Decision**: Underwriting decision has been made
- **Policy Issued**: Policy documents have been generated
- **Policy Delivered**: Documents have been delivered to client
- **Policy In Force**: Policy is active and coverage has begun

Each stage is represented by an icon and connected by a progress bar that fills as the policy advances.

### 2. Policy Information Display
