## Pizza Tracker Application Implications

For our pizza tracker application, we should focus on the key stages that advisors and clients need to track during the policy lifecycle:

1. **Application Submitted** - Initial application has been submitted to the insurance company
2. **Underwriting in Progress** - Application is being reviewed, medical exams scheduled/completed
3. **Medical Review** - Medical information is being evaluated
4. **Final Decision** - Underwriting decision has been made
5. **Policy Issued** - Policy documents have been created
6. **Policy Delivered** - Policy has been delivered to the client
7. **Policy In Force** - First premium paid, policy is now active

These stages provide a clear progression that can be visualized effectively in a pizza tracker-style interface, giving advisors and clients visibility into where the policy stands in the process.
