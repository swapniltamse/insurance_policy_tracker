The Insurance Policy Tracker is a pizza tracker-style application designed to help life insurance advisors track the status of policies as they progress through the underwriting process to inforce status. This application provides clear visualization of the policy lifecycle, improving advisor efficiency and enhancing client communication.

## Features

- Visual policy status tracker with 7 key stages
- Detailed policy information display
- Status details panel with estimated completion dates
- Required actions checklist
- Interactive features (search, notifications, stage details)
- Responsive design for all devices
- Demo controls for presentation purposes

## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the application
2. Use the demo controls at the bottom to:
   - Switch between different policy stages
   - Load different sample policies
   - Show sample notifications

## Presentation Materials

For your tech leadership presentation, we've included:

- `presentation_slides.md`: Comprehensive slides covering the problem statement, solution, features, benefits, and implementation details
- `demo_script.md`: Step-by-step script for demonstrating the application
- `documentation.md`: Detailed documentation on the application's purpose, features, and technical implementation

## Research and Design

We've included our research and design documents for reference:

- `policy_lifecycle_research.md`: Research on the life insurance policy lifecycle
- `design_inspiration.md`: Design inspiration and UI patterns from pizza trackers

## Technical Implementation

The application is built with:

- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and responsive design
- JavaScript for interactivity and data management

No server-side components are required for the prototype. In a production environment, the application would connect to backend systems for real-time policy data.

## Next Steps

Potential next steps for this project include:

1. Integration with existing policy administration systems
2. Development of a client-facing version
3. Addition of automated notifications
4. Implementation of analytics to track processing times
